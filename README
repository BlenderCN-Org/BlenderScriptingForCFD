This repo demonstrates the python scripting in Blender Cycles Render.
It shows how to create multiple materials and shade them differently,
and render them using a python script that can be run from the command line
in the background. This is a ready to run code. It has 5 .stl mesh files
corresponding to a convecting water bubble. The script loops through these files 
and creates and saves the render images. To run this code, do the following in 
the command line in this directory.

blender --background --python BlenderScripting.py

This will create 5 images in this directory.
